# Description 

This is an application that aims to help users with memorizing vocab (words) from other languages. It uses React/Material UI for the front end and Flask/SQLAlchemy for the backend along with Neon DB for the PostgreSQL data base. 

This application displays word modules where users can learn their vocab. A statistics page which shows general user stats such as accuracy, best word (word with highest accuracy) and module specific statistics. Furthermore, users can view their word list which contains all words that have been added along with some simple stats for each individual word. Users can also add/delete words on the Word List page. 

# Running/Building 

Due to the nature of this application, it is difficult to download and run your own instance of Vocabi. Thus, I hope to get this application hosted so that it can be available. When that happens, an update will be provided here.
